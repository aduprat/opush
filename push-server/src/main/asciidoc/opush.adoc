== About

Opush is a free (as in beer and as in speech) ActiveSync server that provides
access to your *OBM* data. It synchronizes your *OBM* account using your device's 
native applications.

With Opush, you don't need to have any extra applications installed on your device in order to
enjoy all capabilities offered by your favorite device: iPhone, iPad,
Android, Windows Phone ...

=== Synchronized Data

Opush is capable of doing bidirectional synchronization of:

* your *emails*
* your *calendar events*
* your personal and shared *address books*

=== Supported Devices

Every ActiveSync client should be able to synchronize with *OBM* through
Opush.

However, there's a limited list of officially supported devices:

=== Limitations

As Microsoft Exchange Server, Opush can't go over some clients limitations (or bugs)!

Be aware that users with Android (=> 4.4) have such https://ci-obm.linagora.com/jira/browse/OP-185[limitations on address books synchronization]. 
Their secondary address books (others than the "contacts" one) are read-only, so please note that:

  * contacts in such address book are in a read-only state, every modification and deletion will be taken into account on your device but ignored by the server.
  * dropping an address book does not remove related contacts on the device
  
All kind of operations are available (and encouraged) on the main address book.
