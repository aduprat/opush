== About

Opush is a free (as in beer and as in speech) ActiveSync server that provides
access to your *OBM* data. It synchronizes your *OBM* account using your device's 
native applications.

With Opush, you don't need to have any extra applications installed on your device in order to
enjoy all capabilities offered by your favorite device: iPhone, iPad,
Android, Windows Phone ...

=== Synchronized Data

Opush is capable of doing bidirectional synchronization of:

* your *emails*
* your *calendar events*
* your personal and shared *address books*

=== Supported Devices

Every ActiveSync client should be able to synchronize with *OBM* through
Opush.

However, there's a limited list of officially supported devices:
