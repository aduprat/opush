=== Administration with the *CRaSH* console

http://www.crashub.org/[*CRaSH*] is a console to administer or monitor an application running on the JVM.

Starting with Opush 2.5.0, Opush integrates *CRaSH* to provide several administration and debug commands. It is enabled by default and is reachable using an SSH client on port +5665+.

==== Prerequisite: Grant Rights to the Admin Profile

Administration with the *CRaSH* console applies to every domain thus you must
give extra rights to the *OBM* domain administrators.

[WARNING]
====
It means that an *OBM* domain administrator actions impact the whole server and
all domains.
====

To grant all rights on +domains+ to an *OBM* domain administrator, you have to
modify +Admin+ user's profile.

To achieve this, authenticate with the *OBM* web interface as an +Admin+ for the
global domain (like +admin0+), click on +Administration+, +User profiles+ then
update the +Admin+ profile. +
There is a +Specific settings+ section where you can give all rights on the +domains+ line.

==== Authentication

By default, authentication is done using the +global.virt+ domain. You can change this in the configuration file (see <<_configuration>>).

When dealing with a single domain instance, +global.virt+ may not exist.   
In this particular case, you have to configure the domain used for authentication (see <<_configuration>>).

In order to connect to *CRaSH*, use the following command to initiate an SSH connection:

[source]
----
$ ssh user@your_server -p port
----

where

  * +user+ is an admin user of the corresponding domain
  * +your_server+ is the IP of the Opush server
  * +port+ is the port of *CRaSH* (default: +5665+)


==== Configuration

Initially, the configuration file +/etc/opush/remote_console.ini+ looks like this (default values):

[source]
.+/etc/opush/remote_console.ini+
----
include::sources/remote_console.ini[]
----

where

  * +console.enable+ may be switched to +false+ in order to disable *CRaSH*
  * +console.ssh.port+ is the port used to connect to *CRaSH*
  * +console.authentication.domain+ is the domain used for authentication


==== Examples

Here is a sample *CRaSH* session

.*CRaSH* welcome

The list of *CRaSH* commands may be displayed by the +help+ command, a help is also provided for each command with the +-h+ switch.
For more details see the official documentation at http://www.crashub.org/

==== Commands

The main goals of this tool are:

 * monitor the Opush server (+dashboard+)
 * display the current configuration (+system+, +jvm+)
 * handle *Cassandra* schema installation and update (+cassandra+)

===== *Cassandra*

====== +schema status+

This command shows status information about the schema. 
It will give a warning if you have not installed the *Cassandra* schema and
inform about optional and mandatory updates.

.+status+ output when no schema is installed
	% schema status
	WARN: Install required
	No schema found, you can create it using the "install" command
	The latest schema version available is 1

	Current: 1 updated the Wed Mar 26 16:25:53 GMT 2014
	Latest : 2


====== +schema install+

This command installs a schema on a new *Cassandra* server.
It is intended to be run only after the first Opush installation.
You won't be able to use Opush until this schema is installed
